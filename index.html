    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h5>Hi! I'm Kara</h5>
    <div id="uspic" ></div>
    <p>My fiancé and I decided long ago that we <em>do not</em> want a traditional wedding. Instead, we want to elope. We both love to travel and make great travel buddies. At this moment, we both want to elope to New Zealand. Based on my research thus far, here are the spots that I think we <em>have</em> to visit.</p>

    <p>Below are some of our other places that we <em>definitely</em> want to travel to someday.</p>

        <h2>Lake Wanaka</h2>
        <div id="wanakapic">&copy; Samuel Ferrara</div>
        <p>Crossing the Haast River you’ll come to Makarora, known as the gateway to Mt Aspiring National Park. There are many stunning walks in and around this small town so, as we mentioned earlier, it pays to have plenty of time up your sleeve. From Makarora, it’s a short distance through alpine scenery and snow capped mountains to Lake Hawea and your destination, Lake Wanaka. </p>

        <div id="mountCook">&copy; Natthawat</div>
        <p>Hikers, mountaineers and avid nature lovers head into Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park to marvel at its mountain ranges, glaciers and remarkable rocky terrains. The national park, part of Te Wāhipounamu World Heritage area, in the southwest of the South Island, is home to Aoraki/Mt Cook – New Zealand’s tallest mountain.</p>

        <h2>Piha Beach</h2>
        <div id="pihaBeach">&copy; Casey Horner</div>
        <p>Popular among surfers, landscape photographers and holidaying Aucklanders not wanting to go too far from the city, Piha Beach has something for everyone. Black sand and a rugged appearance are part of this beach’s appeal. The Lion Rock, a volcanic monolith with a war memorial and unique Māori carvings, is a favourite photo spot for visiting shutterbugs.</p>

        <h2>Cape Reinga</h2>
        <div id="cape">&copy; Lucile Noiriel</div>
        <p>Cape Reinga is right at the top of the North Island – though it’s not quite the northernmost point in New Zealand. Māori legend tells us this is the place where the spirits depart from earth and into the ancestral homeland of Hawaiki. The walk to Cape Reinga’s famous lighthouse provides some spectacular views of the coastlines and its surrounding greenery.</p>

        <h2>Castlepoint</h2>
        <div id="castlepoint">&copy; Louis Andrew</div>
        <p>Castlepoint is a small seaside town on the Wairarapa coast, just north of the capital city, Wellington. Its lighthouse is the tallest on the island – a walk to this 23m (75ft) beauty will expose you to some of the North Island’s most dramatic seaside views. A collection of fossil shells are found on the lighthouse route; if you’re lucky, you might spot native fur seals and birds hiding in full view. The sheltered lagoon at the base is another highlight.</p>
